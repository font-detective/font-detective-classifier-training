The `backgrounds` folder is to be used as negative samples whilst the `positives` folder should be populated with positive samples. A list of their contents can be generated using `./backgrounds.sh` and `positives.sh` respectively.

To generate test samples, which comprise of a distorted positive image applied to one or more negative, background images, run `samples.sh`. 

If you require more background images, a good selection can be found  [here](http://tutorial-haartraining.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/data/negatives/).
