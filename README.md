The `backgrounds` folder is to be used as negative samples whilst the `positives` folder should be populated with positive samples. A list of their contents can be generated using `./backgrounds.sh` and `positives.sh` respectively.

To generate test samples, which comprise of a distorted positive image applied to one or more negative, background images, run `samples.sh`.
