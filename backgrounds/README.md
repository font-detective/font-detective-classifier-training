Negative Samples
----------------

These are images that do not contain the image to be identified. They should probably not contain any fonts at all!

If you require more, run the following command `wget --mirror --no-parent http://tutorial-haartraining.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/data/negatives/` from inside this folder.
